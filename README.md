# Discord-bot-real

These are the backup files for my Discord bot which i made for the the school "GD Geonka Public School".

I made this bot from youtube as i don't have much experience with discord.py or python!

Default command prefix is .$

anyways in 'Main.py' please replace the following:
1. TOKEN='your_token'
2. for filename in os.listdir("path_of_the_folder_named_cogs")
3.c_preifx='.$' please change this to anything you like
only then this bot will work!

NOTE-
Setup a text channel named log-channel for auto logging to work!

Thank you!
